# **Responsive Web Design and Accessibility Workshop**

A workshop geared toward making your application viewable on any device, whether it be a phone, a tablet, a desktop, or a 60" TV.  We will go over the RWD (Responsive Web Design) process and patterns needed to make a fully responsive web app by utilizing media queries and other CSS3 features such as proper grid and flexbox usage.  We will also cover the value of creating a web app with accessibility in mind, allowing your app to reach a wider audience.  One out of every four people has a disability of some kind, and it is important that we enable these people to have the same capabilities on the web as everyone else.

## **Goals**

- Understand the value of reaching the largest audience possible.
  - The product you sell/provide should be accessible to people on whatever media device they're using which means we need to utilize:
    - CSS Units - absolute, relative, and percentages
    - Media Queries - adapating to different screen sizes
    - CSS Grid and Flexbox - tools for a clean layout
    - RWD patterns
  - The product you sell/provide should be accessible to people regardless of any disabilities whether they are visual, auditory, physical, and even cognitive impairments.  It is imperative to think about everyone and try to reach out for a multitude of reasons:
    - By following as many laws as you can in the various countries that have internet users, your site and the company you work for can be safe from any legal proceedings that might come up against you.
    - Being considerate of all people, especially people with disabilities, to be able to access and use whatever service we provide is just the right thing to do.  We are all human and the world works better when we look out for each other.
    - 1 in 4 people have some type of disability, and that's of the people who know and report their disabilities, so it is actually likely even higher.  By making your site accessible to everyone, you can possibly increase your sales, views, and impact by 25%.  This is huge.
  - Once you learn how to do all of these things, there are packages and other tools that can streamline the workflow and make this a simple, cost-effective thing to do with all of your apps.  It is not difficult or costly at all to make a site responsive and accessible when you are thinking about this from the start.  It can, however, be both costly and difficult to add accessibility and responsiveness to a site that was created with no forethought of this.
