# Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design in it's most technical definition contains three features:

1. A grid-based layout
2. Images that resize
3. Media Queries

It is important to design for smaller devices and move to larger and larger devices. Mobile first design will make your life much easier. Web usage is basically split up between mobile devices and desktops, with a smaller percentage of tablet users as the outliers.

## Flexbox and Grids

- Flexbox is for components of an application and small-scale layouts
- Grid is for large-scale application layouts
